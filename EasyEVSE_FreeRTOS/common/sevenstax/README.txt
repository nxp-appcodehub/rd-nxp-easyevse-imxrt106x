The libraries in  the sevenstax/lib/ folder are placeholder libraries and
do NOT contain the Sevenstax implementation for the ISO15118 charging protocol.
To access the actual ISO15118 libraries, please go to nxp.com and download the
archive containing the implementation.

More information on the integration of the ISO15118 stack in the EasyEVSE MCU
project is available in the User Manual (document UM11750).
